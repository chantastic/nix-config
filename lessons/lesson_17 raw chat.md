what are the benefits of setting up $EDITOR and $VISUAL aliases on mac and lunix?

---

**Cursor**

Setting up the `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` environment variables (not technically "aliases") on macOS and Linux provides several important benefits:

### 1. Consistent Editor Experience Across Tools
- Many command-line programs (e.g., `git`, `crontab`, `sudoedit`, `visudo`, `man`, `less`, `systemctl edit`, etc.) use `$EDITOR` or `$VISUAL` to determine which text editor to launch when you need to edit a file.
- By setting these variables, you ensure that all these tools open your preferred editor, providing a consistent editing experience.

### 2. Customization and Productivity
- You can set `$EDITOR` to a terminal-based editor (like `vim`, `nano`, or `emacs`) and `$VISUAL` to a graphical editor (like `code` for VS Code, or `subl` for Sublime Text).
- This allows you to choose the best tool for the job: quick terminal edits or more complex graphical editing.

### 3. Script and Automation Compatibility
- Scripts and automation tools often rely on `$EDITOR` to prompt the user for input or configuration. Setting it ensures scripts work as intended and don’t default to an editor you dislike or don’t know how to use.

### 4. Avoiding Defaults You Don’t Want
- If you don’t set these variables, the system may default to editors like `vi` or `ed`, which may not be user-friendly for everyone.
- Explicitly setting them avoids confusion and accidental use of unfamiliar editors.

### 5. Cross-Platform Consistency
- By setting these variables in your dotfiles (e.g., `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`), you can have the same editor preferences on both macOS and Linux, making your workflow portable.

---

**Typical setup example in your shell config:**
```sh
export EDITOR="vim"
export VISUAL="code"
```
- `$EDITOR` is used for terminal-based editing.
- `$VISUAL` is preferred for graphical editing (if the program supports it).

---

**Summary Table:**

| Variable   | Used for                | Typical Value      | When Used                |
|------------|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| `$EDITOR`  | Terminal editing        | `vim`, `nano`      | CLI tools, scripts       |
| `$VISUAL`  | Graphical editing       | `code`, `subl`     | GUI-capable programs     |

---

**In short:**  
Setting `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` gives you control, consistency, and efficiency when editing files from the command line or scripts, on both macOS and Linux.

```shellscript
export EDITOR="vim"
export VISUAL="code"
```

is there a way to set these environment variables with a backup?

for example, i prefer `nvim` to `vim` but must that software must be installed. but i'm ok with `vim`, if the software isn't installed.

---

**Cursor**

Yes, you can set `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` with a fallback (backup) editor using shell scripting in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`). This ensures that if your preferred editor (like `nvim`) is not installed, it will fall back to another editor (like `vim`).

### Example: Fallback Logic in Shell

```sh
# Set EDITOR with fallback: nvim > vim > nano
if command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="nvim"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="vim"
elif command -v nano >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="nano"
else
  export EDITOR="vi"
fi

# Set VISUAL with similar fallback
if command -v code >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="code --wait"
elif command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="nvim"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="vim"
else
  export VISUAL="vi"
fi
```

### How it works:
- `command -v <editor>` checks if the editor is installed and available in your `$PATH`.
- The first available editor in the list is chosen.
- You can customize the order and add/remove editors as you like.

### Why use `code --wait`?
- For graphical editors like VS Code, the `--wait` flag tells the program to block until the file is closed, which is necessary for many CLI tools to work properly.

---

**Summary:**  
This approach gives you a robust, portable way to always have a working editor, with your preferred choice used when available. Add this logic to your shell config file to make it effective for every new terminal session.

```shellscript
# Set EDITOR with fallback: nvim > vim > nano
if command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="nvim"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="vim"
elif command -v nano >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="nano"
else
  export EDITOR="vi"
fi

# Set VISUAL with similar fallback
if command -v code >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="code --wait"
elif command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="nvim"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="vim"
else
  export VISUAL="vi"
fi
```

is this evaluated lazily or at the time that the terminal shell is opened?

is suspect that it's not possible to put this inside of a function, as i've done with @git.zsh, because these are variables and not program names (or aliases to program names).

---

**Cursor**

Great questions! Let’s clarify both points:

---

### 1. **When are environment variables like `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` evaluated?**

- **Environment variables** are evaluated at the time the shell is started (i.e., when your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` is sourced).
- The logic you put in your shell config (e.g., the `if command -v ...` block) is run **immediately** as the shell starts, and the resulting value is set for the duration of that shell session.
- **They are not evaluated lazily** (i.e., not re-evaluated each time a program checks `$EDITOR`). The value is fixed until you change it and export it again.

---

### 2. **Can you set these variables inside a function?**

- **No, not in the way you might hope.**  
  If you put the export logic inside a function (e.g., `set_editor()`), the variables will only be set if/when you call that function.  
  - If you want the variables to be set automatically for every shell session, the logic must be at the top level of your shell config, **not inside a function** (unless you explicitly call that function in your config).
- **Aliases vs. Variables:**  
  - Aliases and functions (like your `g()` for git) are only used when you type their name in the shell.
  - Environment variables are just values; they are not commands and cannot be “called” like a function or alias.

---

### 3. **Best Practice**

- Place the fallback logic for `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` **directly in your `.zshrc` or equivalent**, not inside a function, unless you also call that function during shell startup.

**Example (top-level in `.zshrc`):**
```sh
if command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="nvim"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="vim"
else
  export EDITOR="nano"
fi
```

---

**Summary Table:**

| Approach         | When evaluated?         | Effectiveness for $EDITOR/$VISUAL |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Top-level logic  | At shell startup       | ✅ Works as intended              |
| Inside function  | Only when function run | ❌ Not automatic                  |

---

**In short:**  
- The fallback logic for `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` should be at the top level of your shell config, not inside a function, for it to work automatically every time you open a new shell.  
- The value is set once per shell session, not lazily.

```shellscript
if command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="nvim"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="vim"
else
  export EDITOR="nano"
fi
```

**User**

i often see EDITOR and VISUAL set to the same value.

is this necessary? or does visual naturally fall back to editor, if VISUAL is not specified?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! Here’s how it works:

---

### 1. **Is it necessary to set both `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL`?**

- **Not strictly necessary** to set both, but it is often done for clarity and explicitness.
- Many people set both to the same value for consistency, especially if they only use one editor.

---

### 2. **Does `$VISUAL` fall back to `$EDITOR`?**

- **Yes, in most well-behaved CLI programs:**  
  - If a program wants a graphical editor, it will check `$VISUAL` first.
  - If `$VISUAL` is not set, it will then check `$EDITOR`.
  - If neither is set, it will fall back to a system default (like `vi` or `ed`).

**This is the standard convention, but not a strict guarantee for every program.**  
Most Unix tools (including `git`, `crontab`, `sudoedit`, etc.) follow this pattern.

---

### 3. **When would you set them differently?**

- If you want a **graphical editor** for some tools and a **terminal editor** for others:
  ```sh
  export EDITOR="vim"
  export VISUAL="code --wait"
  ```
  - Programs that support graphical editing will use `$VISUAL` (`code`).
  - Programs that only support terminal editing will use `$EDITOR` (`vim`).

---

### 4. **If you only set `$EDITOR`**

- You’re safe for most CLI tools.
- If you want to ensure graphical tools use your preferred editor, set `$VISUAL` as well.

---

**Summary Table:**

| Variable   | Checked First | Fallback      | Typical Use         |
|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| `$VISUAL`  | 1st           | `$EDITOR`     | Graphical editors   |
| `$EDITOR`  | 2nd           | System default| Terminal editors    |

---

**In short:**  
- You don’t have to set both, but it’s good practice.
- `$VISUAL` falls back to `$EDITOR` if not set, in most programs.
- Set both if you want to be explicit or use different editors for different contexts.

```shellscript
  export EDITOR="vim"
  export VISUAL="code --wait"
```

---

**User**

obviously the seperation of these to harkens back to the `ed` and `vi` days.

if i feel very comfortable with `nvim`.
are there any programs that will open VISUAL, where i would definitely want to use `code`? or is `nvim` pretty much fine for everything?

---

**Cursor**

Excellent question! The distinction between `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` does indeed come from the days when some editors were strictly terminal-based (`ed`, `vi`) and others were graphical or more interactive.

### If You’re Comfortable With `nvim` for Everything

- **For most users who are comfortable with `nvim`, it is perfectly fine to set both `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` to `nvim`.**
- `nvim` works well in both interactive and non-interactive contexts, and is robust for editing everything from commit messages to system config files.

---

### When Would You Want to Use a Graphical Editor (`code`) for `$VISUAL`?

There are a few scenarios where a graphical editor like VS Code (`code`) might be preferable for `$VISUAL`:

1. **Complex Multi-file Editing**
   - Some tools (e.g., `git rebase -i`, or `git commit` with `--edit`) might open a temporary file, but if you want to open a whole project or multiple files, a graphical editor can be more convenient.

2. **Rich UI Features**
   - Graphical editors provide features like:
     - Side-by-side diffs
     - Syntax highlighting for many languages
     - Integrated terminals, linters, and extensions
   - If you want these features for certain tasks, you might prefer `code` for `$VISUAL`.

3. **Non-terminal Environments**
   - If you’re working in a GUI environment (e.g., launching an editor from a graphical file manager or a GUI app that respects `$VISUAL`), a terminal-based editor like `nvim` may not be ideal.

4. **Editing Large or Binary Files**
   - Some graphical editors handle large files or binary data more gracefully than terminal editors.

---

### Real-World Examples

- **`git commit`**: Opens `$VISUAL` (or `$EDITOR`) for commit messages. `nvim` is fine.
- **`crontab -e`**: Opens `$EDITOR`. `nvim` is fine.
- **`git rebase -i`**: Opens `$EDITOR`. `nvim` is fine.
- **`systemctl edit`**: Opens `$EDITOR`. `nvim` is fine.
- **Some GUI apps**: Might use `$VISUAL` to launch a graphical editor, but this is rare.

---

### Summary Table

| Use Case                        | `nvim` OK? | `code` Preferred? | Notes                                 |
|----------------------------------|:----------:|:-----------------:|---------------------------------------|
| CLI editing (git, crontab, etc.)| ✅         |                   | `nvim` is ideal                       |
| Multi-file/project editing       | ✅         | ✅                | `code` more convenient for projects   |
| GUI app launches editor          |            | ✅                | Rare, but `code` is better here       |
| Large/binary file editing        | ✅         | ✅                | `code` may be smoother                |

---

### **Bottom Line**

- If you’re happy with `nvim` for everything, you can safely set both `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` to `nvim`.
- If you sometimes want a graphical experience (especially for multi-file or project-wide editing), set `$VISUAL` to `code --wait` and `$EDITOR` to `nvim`.
- For most CLI workflows, `nvim` is more than sufficient.

**You can always override the editor for a single command by setting the variable inline:**
```sh
VISUAL="code --wait" git commit
```

Let me know if you want a sample config for this!

```shellscript
VISUAL="code --wait" git commit
```

---

**User**

oh! that's a great tip. i was just about to ask the best way to override for single commands.

i like the way that you did this with the variable because it's universal.

great typ.

---

**Cursor**

Thank you! I’m glad you found the tip helpful.

Just to recap, the universal way to override for a single command is:

```sh
VISUAL="code --wait" git commit
EDITOR="nano" crontab -e
```

- This works for **any** environment variable, not just `$EDITOR` or `$VISUAL`.
- The override only applies to that single command invocation—your global config remains unchanged.

**Bonus:**  
You can even chain overrides if needed:
```sh
VISUAL="code --wait" EDITOR="nvim" some_command
```

If you ever want to make a temporary change for a whole shell session, you can just run:
```sh
export EDITOR="nano"
```
and it will persist for all commands in that session (until you close the shell or change it again).

Let me know if you have any more questions or want more shell tips!

```shellscript
VISUAL="code --wait" git commit
EDITOR="nano" crontab -e
```

```shellscript
VISUAL="code --wait" EDITOR="nvim" some_command
```

```shellscript
export EDITOR="nano"
```

# Lesson 17: Mastering $EDITOR and $VISUAL in Unix Shells

## Why Set $EDITOR and $VISUAL?

Many command-line tools (like `git`, `crontab`, `sudoedit`, etc.) use the `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` environment variables to determine which text editor to launch when you need to edit a file. Setting these variables ensures a consistent and comfortable editing experience across all your tools.

- **$EDITOR**: Used for terminal-based editing.
- **$VISUAL**: Used for graphical or more interactive editing (if supported).

## Best Practices

### 1. Set with Fallbacks
You can set these variables with fallback logic in your shell config (e.g., `.zshrc`, `.bashrc`) so that if your preferred editor isn't installed, another is used:

```sh
if command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="nvim"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="vim"
elif command -v nano >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="nano"
else
  export EDITOR="vi"
fi

if command -v code >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="code --wait"
elif command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="nvim"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="vim"
else
  export VISUAL="vi"
fi
```

### 2. When to Set Both
- Most programs check `$VISUAL` first, then `$EDITOR`.
- If you want the same editor everywhere, set both to the same value.
- If you want a graphical editor for some tools and a terminal editor for others, set them differently.

### 3. Overriding for a Single Command
You can temporarily override these variables for a single command by prefixing the command:

```sh
VISUAL="code --wait" git commit
EDITOR="nano" crontab -e
```
This only affects the command you run, not your global settings.

## Summary Table

| Variable   | Checked First | Fallback      | Typical Use         |
|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| $VISUAL    | 1st           | $EDITOR       | Graphical editors   |
| $EDITOR    | 2nd           | System default| Terminal editors    |

## Key Takeaways
- Set `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` in your shell config for a consistent experience.
- Use fallback logic to ensure you always have a working editor.
- Override the editor for a single command by prefixing the command with the variable assignment.

---

**Example:**

```sh
VISUAL="code --wait" git commit
```

This opens your commit message in VS Code just for this command, even if your default is `nvim`.

```

Lesson 17 has been added to `lesson_17.md`, covering the purpose, best practices, fallback logic, and the single-command override tip for `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL`. The override example is clearly showcased as requested.

If you’d like any tweaks or more examples, just let me know!

**User**

ok. now let's add these variables to my config.

where do you suggest putting them? @shell.nix seems like the most logical place to me but i'm open to suggestion.

---

**Cursor**

You’re absolutely right—`modules/shell.nix` is the most logical and maintainable place to set these variables in your Nix-based setup.

### Why `shell.nix` is the Best Place:
- It’s already configuring your Zsh environment, including session variables and sourcing your custom scripts.
- It ensures the variables are set for every shell session managed by Nix Home Manager.
- It keeps your environment reproducible and declarative.

---

## How to Add `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` with Fallback Logic

Nix’s `sessionVariables` only supports static values, not shell logic.  
**To use fallback logic, you need to add it to your `initExtra` block** (which is evaluated as shell code when Zsh starts).

### Recommended Approach

1. **Add the fallback logic to the `initExtra` block** in `modules/shell.nix`.
2. **(Optional)** Also set a default in `sessionVariables` for tools that might not source your shell config (less common).

---

### Example Edit for `modules/shell.nix`

Add this to your `initExtra` block (inside the triple quotes):

```sh
# Set $EDITOR and $VISUAL with fallback logic
if command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="nvim"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="vim"
elif command -v nano >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="nano"
else
  export EDITOR="vi"
fi

if command -v code >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="code --wait"
elif command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="nvim"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="vim"
else
  export VISUAL="vi"
fi
```

---

**Summary:**  
- Place the fallback logic in the `initExtra` block of your Zsh config in `modules/shell.nix`.
- This ensures the variables are set dynamically and portably for every shell session.

Would you like me to make this edit for you?

```shellscript
# Set $EDITOR and $VISUAL with fallback logic
if command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="nvim"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="vim"
elif command -v nano >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="nano"
else
  export EDITOR="vi"
fi

if command -v code >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="code --wait"
elif command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="nvim"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="vim"
else
  export VISUAL="vi"
fi
```

---

**User**

cool. should we is the `initExtra` above or utilize the @/dotfiles pattern, by linking a dedicated file?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! Both approaches are valid, but here’s a breakdown to help you decide:

---

## 1. **Directly in `initExtra`**
- **Pros:**  
  - Everything is in one place (your Nix config).
  - No need to manage extra files.
- **Cons:**  
  - If the logic grows or you want to reuse it elsewhere, it can get cluttered.
  - Harder to share or edit outside of Nix.

---

## 2. **Dedicated File in `dotfiles/zsh/` (using @/dotfiles pattern)**
- **Pros:**  
  - Keeps your Nix config clean and focused.
  - Easy to edit, version, and reuse the logic in other shell environments (e.g., if you use Bash sometimes).
  - Consistent with how you already manage `git.zsh` and `aliases.zsh`.
- **Cons:**  
  - Slightly more indirection (need to look in two places).

---

## **Recommendation**

**Given your current setup and the fact that you already use the `dotfiles/zsh/` pattern, I recommend creating a new file** (e.g., `editor.zsh`) in `dotfiles/zsh/` with your `$EDITOR`/`$VISUAL` logic.

- This keeps things modular and maintainable.
- You can source it automatically with your existing loop in `initExtra`:
  ```sh
  for f in ~/.config/zsh/*.zsh; do
    source "$f"
  done
  ```
- You can easily update or share your editor logic without touching your Nix config.

---

## **How to Do It**

1. **Create `dotfiles/zsh/editor.zsh`** with the fallback logic.
2. **Ensure it’s linked in your Nix config** (which it will be, if you follow the same pattern as `git.zsh` and `aliases.zsh`).

---

Would you like me to create the `editor.zsh` file with the recommended logic and update your Nix config if needed?

```shellscript
  for f in ~/.config/zsh/*.zsh; do
    source "$f"
  done
```

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

```shellscript
# Set $EDITOR and $VISUAL with fallback logic
if command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="nvim"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="vim"
elif command -v nano >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export EDITOR="nano"
else
  export EDITOR="vi"
fi

if command -v code >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="code --wait"
elif command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="nvim"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="vim"
else
  export VISUAL="vi"
fi

```

I've created `dotfiles/zsh/editor.zsh` with the recommended fallback logic for `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL`. 

Since your `modules/shell.nix` already sources all `~/.config/zsh/*.zsh` files via the `initExtra` loop, and the file will be linked by Home Manager (if you add a line like the others for `editor.zsh`), you’re all set for this to be loaded automatically in every shell session.

Would you like me to add the Home Manager link for `editor.zsh` to your `modules/shell.nix` as well?

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

```plaintext
// ... existing code ...
  home.file.".config/zsh/git.zsh".source = ../dotfiles/zsh/git.zsh;
  home.file.".config/zsh/aliases.zsh".source = ../dotfiles/zsh/aliases.zsh;
  home.file.".config/zsh/editor.zsh".source = ../dotfiles/zsh/editor.zsh;
// ... existing code ...
```

The Home Manager link for `editor.zsh` has been added to your `modules/shell.nix`, following the same pattern as your other Zsh dotfiles. This ensures your `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` logic will be sourced automatically in every shell session.

You can now rebuild your Home Manager configuration to apply the changes. Let me know if you need help with that or have any other questions!

# Creating one-letter aliases for editors

**User**

i have $EDITOR and $VISUAL set up in @editor.zsh. 
but i'd also like to one-letter aliases in the terminal, under `e` and `v`.

but i want them to benefit from completions for the programs they run (which is dynamic, `nvim`, `vim`, `vi`, and possibly others, like `code`).

do i do this with lazy evaluation functions, like @git.zsh? or is there a preferrable alternative?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! You’re on the right track thinking about lazy evaluation functions, like your `g()` in `git.zsh`. Here’s a breakdown of your options and the best practice for your goals:

### What you want:
- `e` and `v` as one-letter aliases for your editor/visual editor.
- They should always launch the right program (nvim, vim, vi, etc.), as determined by your `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` logic.
- They should support tab completions for files, and ideally, for the editor’s own CLI options.

---

## 1. Why not just an alias?
If you do:
```zsh
alias e="$EDITOR"
```
This will not work as expected if `$EDITOR` changes after the alias is defined, and it won’t forward completions for the underlying editor.

---

## 2. Lazy evaluation function (recommended)
A function like your `g()` is the best way. For example:
```zsh
e() { "$EDITOR" "$@"; }
v() { "$VISUAL" "$@"; }
```
This way, it always uses the current value of `$EDITOR`/`$VISUAL`, and passes all arguments.

### Completion support
- **File completion:** Zsh will provide filename completion by default for functions like this.
- **Editor-specific completion:** If you want completions for editor-specific flags (like `nvim --help`), you can "forward" completions from the real editor. Zsh supports this with `compdef`:

```zsh
e() { "$EDITOR" "$@"; }
v() { "$VISUAL" "$@"; }

compdef _command e
compdef _command v
```
Or, for more advanced completion, you can try to forward the completion from the actual editor command:
```zsh
compdef _nvim e
compdef _nvim v
```
But this only works if you know the editor in advance. Since yours is dynamic, `_command` is the safest.

---

## 3. Bonus: Support for VS Code or others
If you want `e` to sometimes launch `code` (VS Code), you can extend your `$EDITOR` logic in `editor.zsh` to check for `code` as well.

---

## Summary
- Use functions for `e` and `v` (like your `g()`).
- Use `compdef _command e` to get basic completion.
- If you want more advanced completions, you’d need to detect the editor and forward the right completion function, but for most use cases, `_command` is sufficient.

Would you like a ready-to-paste snippet for your `editor.zsh`?

```shellscript
alias e="$EDITOR"
```

```shellscript
e() { "$EDITOR" "$@"; }
v() { "$VISUAL" "$@"; }
```

```shellscript
e() { "$EDITOR" "$@"; }
v() { "$VISUAL" "$@"; }

compdef _command e
compdef _command v
```

```shellscript
compdef _nvim e
compdef _nvim v
```

---

**User**

yes.

---

**Cursor**

Here’s a ready-to-paste snippet for your `dotfiles/zsh/editor.zsh` that:

- Defines `e` and `v` as functions, so they always use the current `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL`.
- Sets up completions so you get filename completion (and basic CLI flag completion) for both.

```zsh
# ... existing $EDITOR and $VISUAL logic ...

# One-letter editor functions
e() { "$EDITOR" "$@"; }
v() { "$VISUAL" "$@"; }

# Enable basic command-line completion for e and v
compdef _command e
compdef _command v
```

**How it works:**
- `e foo.txt` will open `foo.txt` in your chosen editor.
- Tab completion after `e` or `v` will suggest files and basic options, just like running the editor directly.

**Where to put it:**  
Add this snippet to the end of your `dotfiles/zsh/editor.zsh` file.

Let me know if you want to support more advanced completions (like editor-specific flags) or want to include VS Code or other editors in your `$EDITOR` logic!

```shellscript
# ... existing $EDITOR and $VISUAL logic ...

# One-letter editor functions
e() { "$EDITOR" "$@"; }
v() { "$VISUAL" "$@"; }

# Enable basic command-line completion for e and v
compdef _command e
compdef _command v
```

---

**User**

let's put this in an `e.zsh` file in @/zsh 

i'd like to split it by command. `e.zsh` and `v.zsh`

---

**Cursor**

```shellscript
# e.zsh: One-letter editor function for $EDITOR

e() { "$EDITOR" "$@"; }

# Enable basic command-line completion for e
compdef _command e

```

```shellscript
# v.zsh: One-letter visual editor function for $VISUAL

v() { "$VISUAL" "$@"; }

# Enable basic command-line completion for v
compdef _command v

```

The `e.zsh` and `v.zsh` files have been created in your `dotfiles/zsh/` directory:

- `e.zsh` defines the `e` function (using `$EDITOR`) and sets up completion.
- `v.zsh` defines the `v` function (using `$VISUAL`) and sets up completion.

**Next steps:**
- Source these files in your `.zshrc` or wherever you load your zsh configs, e.g.:
  ```zsh
  source ~/nix-config/dotfiles/zsh/e.zsh
  source ~/nix-config/dotfiles/zsh/v.zsh
  ```
- You can now use `e` and `v` in your terminal, with completions.

Let me know if you want to further customize the completions or add more features!

```shellscript
  source ~/nix-config/dotfiles/zsh/e.zsh
  source ~/nix-config/dotfiles/zsh/v.zsh
```

---

**User**

will this also allow those single characters to be highlighted in the terminal?

---

**Cursor**

If by "highlighted in the terminal," you mean:

- **Syntax highlighting** (e.g., colored command names in your prompt or when typing)
- **Auto-suggestions** (like zsh-autosuggestions)
- **Tab-completion highlighting**

then yes, your new `e` and `v` functions will behave just like any other command or function in zsh.

### Details

- **Syntax highlighting:**  
  If you use a plugin like `zsh-syntax-highlighting`, your `e` and `v` will be highlighted as valid commands (usually in green or another color for functions/aliases).
- **Tab-completion:**  
  The `compdef _command e` and `compdef _command v` lines ensure that tab-completion works for these commands, so you’ll see file suggestions and completions highlighted as usual.
- **Auto-suggestions:**  
  If you use `zsh-autosuggestions`, it will suggest previous `e` and `v` commands as you type, just like for any other command.

### Note
If you want `e` and `v` to be highlighted in a special way (e.g., a unique color), that would require customizing your zsh theme or syntax-highlighting rules. By default, they’ll be treated as normal commands/functions.

**Summary:**  
Your setup will allow `e` and `v` to be highlighted and completed in the terminal just like any other command.

If you want a special color or style for these, let me know your theme/plugin setup and I can help you customize it!

---

**User**

and yes. please source these in shell

---

**Cursor**

```shellscript
// ... existing code ...
# Source one-letter editor commands
autoload -Uz source
source "${0:A:h}/e.zsh"
source "${0:A:h}/v.zsh"

```

I've updated your `editor.zsh` to source both `e.zsh` and `v.zsh` at the end of the file. This ensures that whenever you source `editor.zsh` (directly or via your `.zshrc`), the `e` and `v` commands will be available in your shell.

You don't need to add additional source lines to your `.zshrc` if you're already sourcing `editor.zsh` there.

Let me know if you want to further customize the setup or need help with anything else!

---

**User**

wait a sec.
before this, we've been sourcing everything in @shell.nix 

should we do this for consistency? or is there a reason you chose a different option?

---

**Cursor**

Great catch! Here’s a breakdown of the two approaches and why you might choose one over the other:

---

### 1. Sourcing in `editor.zsh` (what I just did)
- **Pros:**  
  - Keeps all editor-related logic (including helper functions like `e` and `v`) together.
  - If you ever want to use just the editor setup elsewhere, it’s self-contained.
- **Cons:**  
  - Slightly less consistent if your convention is to source all `.zsh` files from a central place (like in your `shell.nix`).

---

### 2. Sourcing in `shell.nix` (your current convention)
- **Pros:**  
  - Centralizes all sourcing logic, making it easy to see what’s loaded in your shell.
  - Consistent with your current setup, where all `.zsh` files are sourced from `~/.config/zsh/` via the loop in `initExtra`.
  - Avoids double-sourcing or order-of-sourcing issues.
- **Cons:**  
  - Slightly less modular if you want to use `editor.zsh` standalone elsewhere (but this is rarely a problem).

---

### Recommendation

**For your setup, it’s best to follow your existing convention and source all `.zsh` files in `shell.nix`.**  
This keeps things consistent and predictable, and you don’t need to add extra `source` lines inside `editor.zsh`.

---

### What to do

- **Remove** the `source "${0:A:h}/e.zsh"` and `source "${0:A:h}/v.zsh"` lines from `editor.zsh`.
- **Add** these lines to your `shell.nix` (as you already do for other files):

```nix
home.file.".config/zsh/e.zsh".source = ../dotfiles/zsh/e.zsh;
home.file.".config/zsh/v.zsh".source = ../dotfiles/zsh/v.zsh;
```

Your `initExtra` loop will then automatically source them.

---

**Summary:**  
Stick with your current convention for clarity and maintainability.  
Would you like me to make these changes for you?

```plaintext
home.file.".config/zsh/e.zsh".source = ../dotfiles/zsh/e.zsh;
home.file.".config/zsh/v.zsh".source = ../dotfiles/zsh/v.zsh;
```

**User**

terrific. one final question for this session.

my @git.zsh function does not have the `compdef` line. yet it seems to work as expected.

why is that?
and does it bear addition, even if it seems to work right now?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! Here’s a clear explanation:

---

## Why does your `g` function work without `compdef`?

- **Zsh’s default behavior:**  
  When you define a function in zsh, it will try to use the completion for the command of the same name, if it exists.  
  - If you have a function called `g`, and there’s no special completion for `g`, zsh will look for a completion function named `_g`.
  - If `_g` doesn’t exist, but you type `g status` (which calls `git status`), zsh will often “fall through” and use the completion for `git` if it can infer that’s what you’re calling.
- **Why it works for `g`:**  
  Many zsh setups (especially with `oh-my-zsh` or similar frameworks, or with `compinit` and `compdef` properly set up) will automatically associate your `g` function with the completions for `git`, because it’s a common pattern.

---

## Should you add `compdef` for `g`?

- **It’s not strictly necessary** if it’s working, but it’s a good idea for clarity and future-proofing.
- **Explicit is better than implicit:**  
  By adding:
  ```zsh
  compdef g=git
  ```
  you ensure that `g` always gets the same completions as `git`, regardless of changes to your zsh config, plugins, or future zsh versions.

---

## Summary

- Your `g` function works because zsh is smart about completion fallbacks, especially for common wrappers like `g` for `git`.
- Adding `compdef g=git` is a best practice for clarity and robustness, but not strictly required if it works for you now.

**Would you like me to add this line to your `git.zsh` for you?**

```shellscript
  compdef g=git
```

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

```shellscript
// ... existing code ...
compdef g=git

```

I've added the line `compdef g=git` to the end of your `git.zsh` file. This ensures that your `g` function will always use git's completions, making your setup more robust and explicit.

If you have any more questions or need further tweaks, just let me know!

**User**

please write a lesson about what we learned here.
this most important to me are the topic of evaluation time (and trade-offs) and compdef.

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! Here’s a concise lesson summarizing what we learned, with a focus on evaluation time, function/alias trade-offs, and the use of `compdef` in zsh.

---

# Lesson: Zsh Functions, Evaluation Time, and Command Completion

## 1. Evaluation Time: Aliases vs. Functions

### Aliases
- **Definition:** Simple text substitutions, expanded by the shell before command execution.
- **Evaluation:** Aliases are expanded at parse time, not at execution time.
- **Limitation:** If you set `alias e="$EDITOR"`, it captures the value of `$EDITOR` at the time the alias is defined. If `$EDITOR` changes later, the alias does not update.
- **Use case:** Best for static, unchanging commands.

### Functions
- **Definition:** Shell functions are blocks of code executed when called.
- **Evaluation:** Functions are evaluated at execution time. If you define:
  ```zsh
  e() { "$EDITOR" "$@"; }
  ```
  it will use the current value of `$EDITOR` every time you run `e`.
- **Advantage:** Dynamic, always up-to-date with environment changes.
- **Use case:** Best for wrappers around commands that may change, or when you want to add logic.

#### **Trade-off Summary**
- Use **aliases** for static, simple substitutions.
- Use **functions** for dynamic, context-sensitive commands.

---

## 2. Command Completion with `compdef`

### What is `compdef`?
- `compdef` is a zsh builtin that associates a completion function with a command or function.
- Example: `compdef g=git` tells zsh to use git’s completions for your `g` function.

### Why is it needed?
- By default, zsh tries to guess completions for functions, but this is not always reliable, especially for custom wrappers.
- Explicitly setting `compdef` ensures your function gets the right completions, regardless of shell configuration or plugins.

### When should you use it?
- Whenever you create a function that wraps or mimics another command (e.g., `g` for `git`, `e` for `$EDITOR`), add a `compdef` line to guarantee correct completions.

### Example:
```zsh
g() {
  if [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; then
    git "$@"
  else
    git status -sb
  fi
}
compdef g=git
```
This ensures `g` has the same completions as `git`.

---

## 3. Best Practices

- **For dynamic commands:** Use functions, not aliases.
- **For robust completions:** Use `compdef` to explicitly associate your function with the correct completion logic.
- **For maintainability:** Source your function files consistently (e.g., via a central loop in your shell config).

---

## 4. Summary Table

| Approach   | Dynamic? | Supports Completion? | Best For                |
|------------|----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Alias      | No       | Sometimes           | Static commands         |
| Function   | Yes      | Yes (with compdef)  | Dynamic/wrapper commands|

---

## 5. Key Takeaways

- **Evaluation time matters:** Functions are evaluated when run, so they always use the latest environment.
- **Explicit is better:** Use `compdef` to ensure your custom functions get the right completions.
- **Consistency:** Source your shell customizations in a consistent, maintainable way.

unfortunately, i'm getting this error, where the bare `vim` command works.

explain why and propose a solution.

```

chan@Mac nix-config % vim .       
chan@Mac nix-config % 

```

---

**Cursor**

Great diagnostic question! Here’s what’s happening and how to fix it:

---

## Why you see `permission denied` for `e` and `v`

Your error:
```
v: permission denied: 
e: permission denied: 
```
but `vim .` works.

### The cause

This error usually means that the shell is trying to execute a file named `e` or `v` in your current directory, **not** your function.

#### Why?
- In zsh (and most shells), if there is an executable file in your current directory named `e` or `v`, and you type `e` or `v`, the shell will try to run that file **before** looking for a function or alias.
- If such a file exists but is **not executable** (or is a directory), you get `permission denied`.

#### How to check:
```zsh
ls -l ./e ./v
```
If you see files or directories named `e` or `v`, that’s the problem.

---

## Solution

### 1. Remove or rename the conflicting files/directories

If you don’t need them:
```zsh
rm ./e ./v
```
Or rename them if you do need them for something else.

### 2. (Optional) Check your `$PATH`

If you have a file named `e` or `v` earlier in your `$PATH` than your function definitions, the shell will use that. But in your case, it’s almost certainly a file in the current directory.

---

## Why does `vim .` work?

- There is no file named `vim` in your current directory, so the shell finds the `vim` binary in your `$PATH` as expected.

---

## Summary

- The shell is finding a file named `e` or `v` in your current directory and trying to execute it.
- Remove or rename those files, and your functions will work as intended.

---

**Let me know if you want a command to automatically check for and remove these files, or if you want to discuss how command lookup order works in zsh!**

```plaintext
v: permission denied: 
e: permission denied: 
```

```shellscript

```

```shellscript

---

**User**

i don't believe these are the issue. check out this output:

```
chan@Mac nix-config % ls -l ./e           
ls: ./e: No such file or directory
chan@Mac nix-config % which v 
v () {
	"$VISUAL" "$@"
}

```

---

**Cursor**

Thank you for the extra details and output. This rules out a file conflict and confirms that `v` is a function as expected.

Let’s dig deeper:

---

## What’s Actually Happening

The error:
```
v: permission denied:
```
with no file named `v` in the directory, and `which v` showing the function, suggests that the function is being called, but something is wrong with how it tries to execute `$VISUAL` (or `$EDITOR` for `e`).

### The likely cause

- If `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR` is **empty** or set to a non-executable value, then the function:
  ```zsh
  v() { "$VISUAL" "$@"; }
  ```
  will try to run an empty command, resulting in a "permission denied" error (because the shell tries to execute an empty string).

#### To confirm:
Run:
```zsh
echo "$VISUAL"
echo "$EDITOR"
```
If either is empty, or set to something invalid, that’s the problem.

---

## Why does `vim .` work?

- `vim` is a real command in your `$PATH`, so it works regardless of `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR`.

---

## Why might `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR` be empty?

- Your `editor.zsh` sets them based on the presence of `nvim`, `vim`, or `vi`:
  ```zsh
  if command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    export VISUAL="nvim"
  elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    export VISUAL="vim"
  else
    export VISUAL="vi"
  fi
  ```
- If this file is sourced **before** your `$PATH` is set up, or before those editors are available, the variables may not be set correctly.

---

## Solution

### 1. Check the values
Run:
```zsh
echo "$VISUAL"
echo "$EDITOR"
```
If they are empty, that’s the issue.

### 2. Ensure `editor.zsh` is sourced **after** your `$PATH` is set up

- In your Nix config, make sure that the `PATH` is set before sourcing your `.zsh` files.
- Or, in your shell startup, ensure that the editor detection logic runs after your environment is ready.

### 3. Add a fallback or error message in your functions

You can make your functions safer:
```zsh
e() {
  if [[ -z "$EDITOR" ]]; then
    echo "Error: \$EDITOR is not set" >&2
    return 1
  fi
  "$EDITOR" "$@"
}
v() {
  if [[ -z "$VISUAL" ]]; then
    echo "Error: \$VISUAL is not set" >&2
    return 1
  fi
  "$VISUAL" "$@"
}
```

**User**

i believe thet problem is that i accidentally removed the `editor.zsh` link in @shell.nix, when i renamed e and v files

---

**Cursor**

Excellent diagnosis! If the `editor.zsh` link was missing from your `shell.nix`, then `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` would not be set at all—leading to the exact “permission denied” error you saw when running `e` or `v`.

### Why this causes the error

- Your `e` and `v` functions rely on `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` being set by `editor.zsh`.
- If `editor.zsh` is not sourced, those variables are empty.
- When you run `e .`, the shell tries to execute an empty command, resulting in `permission denied`.

### Solution

**Ensure this line is present in your `shell.nix`:**
```nix
home.file.".config/zsh/editor.zsh".source = ../dotfiles/zsh/editor.zsh;
```
And that your `initExtra` loop sources all `.zsh` files in `~/.config/zsh/`.

---

### What to do next

1. Make sure the above line is in your `shell.nix` (it is, according to your latest snippet).
2. Rebuild your Nix environment (e.g., `home-manager switch` or your usual process).
3. Restart your shell or source your zsh configs.

---

### Confirm the fix

After fixing, check:
```zsh
echo $EDITOR
echo $VISUAL
```
They should show `nvim`, `vim`, or `vi` (depending on your system).

Then:
```zsh
e .
v .
```
should work as expected.

---

**Summary:**  
The missing `editor.zsh` link was the root cause. Restoring it and rebuilding your environment will resolve the issue!

ok. if `nvim` > `vim` > `vi`.

what is the equivalent for `ed`?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! If you want to set up a similar fallback logic for `ed` (the classic line editor), you would check for its presence and set a variable accordingly.

However, unlike `nvim`, `vim`, and `vi`, there aren’t really “modern” alternatives to `ed`—it’s a very old, standard tool, and if it’s not present, there’s rarely a direct drop-in replacement. But you can still write fallback logic for completeness.

### Typical fallback order for line editors:
- `ed` (the standard)
- `ex` (a line editor mode of `vi`—almost always present if `vi` is)
- `sed` (not interactive, but sometimes used for batch editing)

**So, the closest fallback chain would be:**
1. `ed`
2. `ex`
3. (optionally) print a warning or fallback to `vi` in ex mode: `vi -e`

### Example Zsh logic:
```zsh
if command -v ed >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export LINE_EDITOR="ed"
elif command -v ex >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export LINE_EDITOR="ex"
elif command -v vi >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export LINE_EDITOR="vi -e"
else
  export LINE_EDITOR=""
fi
```

- `ed` is the classic line editor.
- `ex` is the line editor interface to `vi`.
- `vi -e` runs `vi` in ex mode, which is line-oriented.

**Usage:**
```zsh
le() { "$LINE_EDITOR" "$@"; }
compdef _command le
```

---

**Summary Table:**

| Variable      | Fallback Order                |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| `$EDITOR`     | nvim → vim → vi              |
| `$VISUAL`     | nvim → vim → vi              |
| `$LINE_EDITOR`| ed → ex → vi -e (ex mode)    |

Let me know if you want this added to your config!

```shellscript
if command -v ed >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export LINE_EDITOR="ed"
elif command -v ex >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export LINE_EDITOR="ex"
elif command -v vi >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export LINE_EDITOR="vi -e"
else
  export LINE_EDITOR=""
fi
```

```shellscript
le() { "$LINE_EDITOR" "$@"; }
compdef _command le
```

ok. so, give the way that i have these lazy, function aliases set up.

i could reasonable rename these to `ed` and `vi`, if i wanted to.

obviously i would no longer be able to use those commands, but i don't intend to anyway.

can you think of any additional concerns i'm missing, with such a setup?

---

**Cursor**

You're correct: you can absolutely define functions named `ed` and `vi` in your shell, overriding the system commands of the same name. This is a valid approach if you never intend to use the original `ed` or `vi` binaries directly.

Here are the main considerations and potential concerns with this setup:

---

## 1. **Overriding System Commands**
- **Effect:** Your function will always take precedence over the system binary in your shell session.
- **Consequence:** You (and any scripts you run interactively) will never invoke the original `ed` or `vi` unless you explicitly call them with their full path (e.g., `/usr/bin/vi`).

---

## 2. **Script and Tool Compatibility**
- **Interactive shell:** Your function will be used.
- **Non-interactive scripts:** Scripts that use `#!/bin/sh` or `#!/bin/bash` and call `vi` or `ed` will still use the system binaries, unless you override them globally (which is rare and not recommended).
- **Some tools may invoke `vi` or `ed` directly:** If you want to ensure your function is used everywhere, you’d need to manipulate your `$PATH` or use a wrapper script, but this is generally not necessary for most users.

---

## 3. **Tab Completion and Shell Features**
- Your function can have its own completions (as you’ve set up with `compdef`).
- You lose any built-in completions for the original command, but since you don’t intend to use them, this is not a concern.

---

## 4. **Portability**
- If you share your dotfiles or work on a system where you do want the original `vi` or `ed`, you’ll need to remember to comment out or remove your function definitions.
- Other users or collaborators may be surprised if they expect the standard behavior of `vi` or `ed`.

---

## 5. **Emergency Recovery**
- In rare cases (e.g., system recovery, minimal environments), you might want the original `vi` or `ed` for editing config files. If your function is broken or `$EDITOR` is unset, you could be left without a working editor in your shell.
- **Mitigation:** You can always run `/usr/bin/vi` or `/bin/ed` directly if needed.

---

## 6. **Debugging**
- If you ever need to debug issues with the real `vi` or `ed`, you’ll need to bypass your function.

---

## 7. **Shell Startup Performance**
- Defining a few functions has negligible impact on shell startup time.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Concern                | Impact in Your Setup         | Mitigation/Notes                |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Overriding system cmd  | Always use your function    | Use full path for original       |
| Script compatibility   | No effect on scripts        | Only affects interactive shell   |
| Completion             | Your function’s completion  | Not an issue                    |
| Portability            | May surprise others         | Document in your dotfiles        |
| Emergency recovery     | May need real editor        | Use full path if needed          |
| Debugging              | Must bypass function        | Use full path                    |
| Performance            | No issue                    |                                  |

---

## **Conclusion**

If you’re aware of these trade-offs and are comfortable with them, there’s no technical reason not to override `ed` and `vi` with your own functions in your interactive shell.

**Tip:**  
Consider adding a comment in your dotfiles explaining the override, for your future self or collaborators.

yeah. let's do it.

the ability to run thru `/usr/bin/vi` is a very easy escape hatch.

let's rename the files as well

**Cursor**

```shellscript
# ed.zsh: One-letter line editor function for $LINE_EDITOR

if command -v ed >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export LINE_EDITOR="ed"
elif command -v ex >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export LINE_EDITOR="ex"
elif command -v vi >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export LINE_EDITOR="vi -e"
else
  export LINE_EDITOR=""
fi

ed() {
  if [[ -z "$LINE_EDITOR" ]]; then
    echo "Error: No line editor found (ed, ex, or vi -e)" >&2
    return 1
  fi
  eval "$LINE_EDITOR" "$@"
}

compdef _command ed

```

```shellscript
# vi.zsh: One-letter visual editor function for $VISUAL

vi() {
  if [[ -z "$VISUAL" ]]; then
    echo "Error: $VISUAL is not set" >&2
    return 1
  fi
  "$VISUAL" "$@"
}

compdef _command vi

```

```plaintext
// ... existing code ...
  home.file.".config/zsh/git.zsh".source = ../dotfiles/zsh/git.zsh;
  home.file.".config/zsh/aliases.zsh".source = ../dotfiles/zsh/aliases.zsh;
  home.file.".config/zsh/editor.zsh".source = ../dotfiles/zsh/editor.zsh;
  home.file.".config/zsh/ed.zsh".source = ../dotfiles/zsh/ed.zsh;
  home.file.".config/zsh/vi.zsh".source = ../dotfiles/zsh/vi.zsh;
} 

```

Your setup has been updated:

- `ed.zsh` now provides an `ed` function with fallback logic (`ed` → `ex` → `vi -e`).
- `vi.zsh` now provides a `vi` function using `$VISUAL`.
- The old `e.zsh` and `v.zsh` files have been removed.
- `shell.nix` now links `ed.zsh` and `vi.zsh` instead of the old files.

**You can now use `ed` and `vi` as your custom, lazy-evaluated editor commands.**  
If you ever need the system versions, just use `/usr/bin/vi` or `/bin/ed`.

update @lesson_18.md to reflect our decision to repurpose `vi` to run the most modern installed program (falling back to vi).

# Lesson 18: Zsh Functions, Evaluation Time, and Command Completion

## 1. Evaluation Time: Aliases vs. Functions

### Aliases
- **Definition:** Simple text substitutions, expanded by the shell before command execution.
- **Evaluation:** Aliases are expanded at parse time, not at execution time.
- **Limitation:** If you set `alias e="$EDITOR"`, it captures the value of `$EDITOR` at the time the alias is defined. If `$EDITOR` changes later, the alias does not update.
- **Use case:** Best for static, unchanging commands.

### Functions
- **Definition:** Shell functions are blocks of code executed when called.
- **Evaluation:** Functions are evaluated at execution time. If you define:
  ```zsh
  vi() { "$VISUAL" "$@"; }
  ```
  it will use the current value of `$VISUAL` every time you run `vi`.
- **Advantage:** Dynamic, always up-to-date with environment changes.
- **Use case:** Best for wrappers around commands that may change, or when you want to add logic.

#### **Trade-off Summary**
- Use **aliases** for static, simple substitutions.
- Use **functions** for dynamic, context-sensitive commands.

---

## 2. Repurposing Standard Commands: The `vi` Example

A powerful pattern is to override standard editor commands (like `vi`) with a shell function that launches the most modern installed editor, falling back as needed. For example:

```zsh
if command -v nvim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="nvim"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export VISUAL="vim"
else
  export VISUAL="vi"
fi

vi() {
  if [[ -z "$VISUAL" ]]; then
    echo "Error: $VISUAL is not set" >&2
    return 1
  fi
  "$VISUAL" "$@"
}
compdef _command vi
```

This means that running `vi` in your shell will always launch your preferred, most modern editor, but you can still access the system `vi` with `/usr/bin/vi` if needed.

### Trade-offs and Considerations
- **Pros:**
  - Always get your preferred editor, even when muscle memory types `vi`.
  - Consistent experience across systems.
- **Cons:**
  - You lose direct access to the system `vi` unless you use the full path.
  - May surprise collaborators or scripts expecting the original `vi` behavior in your interactive shell.
  - In rare recovery situations, you may need to bypass your function.

**Best Practice:**
- Document this override in your dotfiles for clarity.
- Only override commands you are sure you do not need in their original form interactively.

---

## 3. Command Completion with `compdef`

### What is `compdef`?
- `compdef` is a zsh builtin that associates a completion function with a command or function.
- Example: `compdef g=git` tells zsh to use git’s completions for your `g` function.

### Why is it needed?
- By default, zsh tries to guess completions for functions, but this is not always reliable, especially for custom wrappers.
- Explicitly setting `compdef` ensures your function gets the right completions, regardless of shell configuration or plugins.

### When should you use it?
- Whenever you create a function that wraps or mimics another command (e.g., `g` for `git`, `vi` for `$VISUAL`), add a `compdef` line to guarantee correct completions.

### Example:
```zsh
g() {
  if [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; then
    git "$@"
  else
    git status -sb
  fi
}
compdef g=git
```
This ensures `g` has the same completions as `git`.

---

## 4. Best Practices

- **For dynamic commands:** Use functions, not aliases.
- **For robust completions:** Use `compdef` to explicitly associate your function with the correct completion logic.
- **For maintainability:** Source your function files consistently (e.g., via a central loop in your shell config).
- **For overrides:** Clearly document any overrides of standard commands in your dotfiles.

---

## 5. Summary Table

| Approach   | Dynamic? | Supports Completion? | Best For                |
|------------|----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Alias      | No       | Sometimes           | Static commands         |
| Function   | Yes      | Yes (with compdef)  | Dynamic/wrapper commands|
| Function (override) | Yes | Yes (with compdef) | Repurposing standard commands |

---

## 6. Key Takeaways

- **Evaluation time matters:** Functions are evaluated when run, so they always use the latest environment.
- **Explicit is better:** Use `compdef` to ensure your custom functions get the right completions.
- **Consistency:** Source your shell customizations in a consistent, maintainable way.
- **Repurposing standard commands can be powerful,** but should be done thoughtfully and documented for clarity.

```
